<h1>My Streaming Website</h1>

<h4>That's my first Stremaming website that i learned in Alura</h4>

The project was developed entirely from me. Both the images and the development of the site.

I used only HTML and CSS, something basic to practice the concepts of both markup.

In the course it was proposed to make a Streaming site (but not complete).

The idea was to make a streaming site where it would have only the movies that were awarded by the Oscar. With this I put a generic name like "Oscar+", following the same design proposed by Alura.

The images were edited with Photoshop, and nothing else.

The site is not yet adaptable for mobile devices, only for computers, I'm still working on it
